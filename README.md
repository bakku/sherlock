# Sherlock

Due to the acquirement of Startpage.com by System1 ([link](https://restoreprivacy.com/startpage-system1-privacy-one-group/))
I had to search out for an alternative for Startpage. Duckduckgo has a wonderful design and UX, however, the search results
are just mediocre. Searx fetches its search results from other providers like Startpage, however, the UX and design of it
does not appeal to me. Thus, Sherlock tries to combine the best of both worlds. It tries to be a simple search engine that fetches
the high quality search results of Google, combined with a simple and sleek design.
